# Hello Rabbit

Learning how to RabbitMQ in this life lol.

## Getting Started

- Use the [documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html) don't dull yourself

- run the [receive.py](https://github.com/BolajiOlajide/hello-rabbit/blob/master/receive.py) file in your console with the command

```bash
python receive.py
```

this won;t quit as it'd be listening for new messages.

- next you can start sending messages using the [send.py](https://github.com/BolajiOlajide/hello-rabbit/blob/master/send.py) file by starting it with the command

```bash
python send.py
```

That's all
